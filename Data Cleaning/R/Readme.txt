Project Overview:
As part of an assessment simulating a role as a data analyst for a chosen brand, I undertook a comprehensive data analysis 
project using R programming language. The project involved synthesizing realistic yet simulated data relevant to a specific 
brand, combining multiple datasets, preprocessing, and conducting insightful analyses.

Assigned Role and Brand Selection:
My role was to act as a data analyst for one of the following brands: Woolworths, a major Australian grocery chain; Bunnings, 
a major hardware retailer; or Uber, a market leader in ride-sharing. I chose to focus on [Brand Name/Company Name], and 
throughout the project, I aimed to simulate data representative of the brand's operations and customer interactions.

Key Tasks and Deliverables:
* Data Generation: I generated at least two synthetic datasets, each comprising a minimum of 100 rows and 5-10 variables. 
These datasets encompassed various data types (numeric, character, factor, etc.), including a common variable across them. 
I ensured that one dataset contained correlated random data and introduced missing values in one column (approximately 5% 
of values per row).

* Merging and Preprocessing: After generating the datasets, I merged them using appropriate R functions. The resulting dataset 
encompassed multiple data types and included variables suitable for type conversions (e.g., character/numeric to factor). I 
also labeled and/or ordered at least one factor variable.

* Data Structure Check and Type Conversion: I meticulously checked the structure of the combined data and performed necessary 
data type conversions using Module 3 techniques. I ensured all variables were appropriately formatted for subsequent analyses.

* Summary Statistics Generation: Utilizing categorical variables, I performed a group-wise analysis and generated summary 
statistics for a numeric variable. This included mean, median, first and third quartiles, and standard deviation calculations.

* Handling Missing Values: I systematically scanned all variables for missing values and employed suitable techniques (Module 5) 
to handle and manage missing data effectively.

Final Deliverables:
The culmination of this project included an R Markdown report detailing each step of the analysis. The report showcased the R 
codes used, their outputs, explanations for each step, and insights derived from the data analysis. Additionally, I recorded a 
3-5 minute video presentation outlining the main points covered in the report.

Key Learnings and Takeaways:
Through this assessment, I honed my skills in data generation, preprocessing, merging, summary statistics generation, and handling 
missing data using R programming. This project not only allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge but also offered practical insights 
into the complexities of data analysis within a specific industry context.

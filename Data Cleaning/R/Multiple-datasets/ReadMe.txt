Project Overview:
-----------------
As part of a comprehensive data preprocessing class, I embarked on a dynamic project that 
involved merging, transforming, and reshaping datasets using the R programming language. 
This assignment aimed to demonstrate proficiency in handling diverse datasets, ensuring data 
integrity, and employing advanced techniques for effective data preprocessing.

Chosen Data Sources:
--------------------
For this project, I selected datasets from reputable open sources, adhering to the principles 
of Creative Commons Licensing for transparency and shareability. The chosen datasets covered 
various domains, such as crime statistics, per capita income, and other relevant socio-economic 
factors.

Key Project Tasks and Learning Outcomes:
----------------------------------------
* Merging Datasets: I integrated at least two datasets, creating a comprehensive assessment dataset. 
For example, crime statistics for cities/states in Australia were merged with per capita income 
data to create a rich dataset for analysis.

* Data Type Variety: The assessment dataset incorporated multiple data types, including numeric, 
character, and factor variables. This diversity allowed me to showcase expertise in handling varied 
data structures.

* Data Type Conversions: I strategically selected variables that facilitated necessary data type 
conversions, such as converting character to factor, character to date, and numeric to factor. 
This process showcased my ability to handle diverse data formats.

* Factor Variable Labeling/Ordering: Ensuring the inclusion of at least one factor variable that 
required labeling and/or ordering, I adhered to best practices in data representation.

* Untidy Data Handling: I identified and addressed untidy aspects within one of the datasets, 
explaining the rationale behind considering it untidy. Subsequently, I applied steps to transform 
the data into a tidy format.

* Variable Creation/Mutation: A new variable was created or mutated based on existing variables, 
enhancing the dataset's richness. For instance, creating a savings variable from income and expense 
variables.

* Handling Missing Values and Errors: Rigorous scanning for missing values, special values, and errors 
was conducted. Techniques outlined in Module 5 were applied to address any identified issues, with 
thorough documentation of the rationale behind each approach.

* Outlier Detection and Treatment: Numeric variables were scrutinized for outliers, and appropriate 
techniques from Module 6 were employed to manage outliers. Clear reasoning and documentation accompanied 
each step.

* Data Transformations: At least one variable underwent transformation to achieve specific goals, 
such as altering the scale, converting non-linear relations to linear ones, or normalizing distributions.

* Video Presentation: The project's key insights, methodologies, and outcomes were succinctly presented 
in a 3â€“5-minute video. This presentation encapsulated the main points of the report, providing an overview 
of the entire data preprocessing process.

Utilized Packages and Functions:
--------------------------------
Throughout the project, a range of R packages and functions were employed, including readr, dplyr, tidyr, 
ggplot2, and others. Additionally, custom functions were used, showcasing the accumulated knowledge gained 
throughout the semester.

Learning Outcomes:
------------------
This project allowed me to showcase skills in data integration, type conversions, tidy data principles, 
and advanced data preprocessing techniques. By adhering to best practices and leveraging open-source tools, 
I successfully navigated complex datasets, ensuring their suitability for statistical analysis.

## Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and analyses in the field of data science, 
covering a wide range of topics including data cleaning, analysis, visualization, machine learning, and more.

## About Me

I am a passionate data enthusiast with a background in IoT programming. With a keen interest in leveraging data-driven 
insights to solve real-world problems, I continuously strive to expand my skills and explore new avenues in the realm of data science.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Data Modelling & Data Exploration: COVID-19 Insights](https://github.com/VasithaTilakumara/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/Data%20Modelling/SQL)
- Description:  This project utilizes a publicly available dataset, focusing on global COVID-19 
                  vaccinations. The dataset includes information on vaccination rates, types, and 
                  daily observations across various countries. The project begins with designing a 
                  database. Following database creation and data importation, SQL queries are employed 
                  to investigate different aspects of the dataset. Subsequently, data visualizations 
                  are generated using Excel, presenting insights from the queries in an intuitive and 
                  visually appealing manner.
- Tools/Technologies Used: SQLite Studio, Lucid Chart & Ms Excel.
- Key Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization & database management.
- Visualizations: Include visualizations or results from the project (if applicable).

### [Project 2: Data Cleaning: Multiple Data sets](https://github.com/VasithaTilakumara/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/Data%20Cleaning/R/Multiple-datasets)
- Description:  Demonstrated proficiency in merging, transforming, and
                  reshaping datasets using the R programming language. Ensured
                  data integrity and employed advanced techniques for effective
                  data preprocessing. Successfully handled diverse datasets to
                  prepare them for analysis.
- Tools/Technologies Used: Rstudio
- Key Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning
